This is curated repository of resources on bias and machine unlearning in Large Language Models. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive list of relevant resources related to these topics that can support my research and dissertation, under the advisorship of [PhD Edna Dias Canedo](https://ednacanedo.github.io/), in the [Professional Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering (PPEE)](https://ppee.unb.br/) at the [University of Brasília (UnB)](https://international.unb.br/), [Department of Electrical Engineering (ENE)](http://www.ene.unb.br/).
